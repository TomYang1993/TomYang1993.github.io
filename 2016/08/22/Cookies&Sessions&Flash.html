    <h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>
<p>In last post, we have talked about how to keep data between requests, but not clear about<br />
  the relationship between cookies and sessions. Cookies are key-value data pairs that are stored in the user’s browser until they reach their specified expiration date. Cookie can be interpreted as a special hash. It is attached on every web request and carries on mostly user’s info.</p>

<p>In rails, according to my search, sessions and cookies don’t have much difference. Rails work with cookies to make it more secure. The info is still stored as a hash in the cookies, so user puts in some data in the cookies, and then rails app extracts that data. Sessions are like some part of the cookies.</p>

<p>Of course, there are other ways to store the data in sessions, check the <a href="http://www.justinweiss.com/articles/how-rails-sessions-work/">link</a></p>

<h2 id="sessions-and-flashes">Sessions and Flashes</h2>
<p>Sessions are not hash in nature, session just act like a hash. It is a method and rails pretend it is a hash and then programmers are easy to work with. To better understand sessions, let me introduce his brother, flash!</p>

<p>Normally when you purchased a product, there would be a message showing successful purchase(no matter in what form). And then when you refresh the page, it would disappear in just a flash. You must be familiar with this situation. That’s a flash message!</p>

<p><img src="http://assets.materialup.com/uploads/f03c6dc2-389d-4122-ae4f-9efb13294d8d/03d17e30671583.562e33d4c8f75.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Session and flash are very similar, except that flash can <strong>only last one request</strong>! From last post, we know that session can last many requests until user close the browser or sign out. But flash can only last one request, <strong>it will be wiped out in the next request!</strong></p>

<h2 id="flashes-in-rails">Flashes in rails</h2>
<p>There exists a generic system to show users that an action was performed successfully, or more importantly, failed. This system is known as “flash messages”.
Normally, we set up flash message in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">application.html.erb</code> above the <code class="highlighter-rouge">yield</code> section.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"> <span class="err">&lt;</span>%=  flash.each do |name,message|%&gt;
   <span class="err">&lt;</span>%= message %&gt;
 <span class="err">&lt;</span>% end %&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<p>Then set up the flash hash in the controller or model to take in the info and type of the flash message.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"> <span class="n">flash</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:success</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"The system has been successfully updated !"</span>
 <span class="n">flash</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:danger</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Your purchase is not successful !"</span>
 <span class="n">flash</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:warning</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Are you sure to delete this item ?"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Usually, flash message pairs with redirection, and the flash message will be shown on the page you direct to.</p>

<p>When we deal with validations, error messages can be a lot, so message attribute of the flash can be an array. So we have to adjust flash both in the view and controller.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="err">&lt;</span>% flash.each do |name, message| %&gt;
   <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"alert alert-&lt;%= name %&gt; alert-dismissible"</span> <span class="na">role=</span><span class="s">"alert"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
     <span class="nt">&lt;button</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"button"</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"close"</span> <span class="na">data-dismiss=</span><span class="s">"alert"</span> <span class="na">aria-label=</span><span class="s">"Close"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;span</span> <span class="na">aria-hidden=</span><span class="s">"true"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span><span class="ni">&amp;times;</span><span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</span>
     <span class="err">&lt;</span>% if message.is_a?(Array) %&gt;
      <span class="nt">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
       <span class="err">&lt;</span>% message.each do |msg| %&gt;
        <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>  <span class="err">&lt;</span>%= msg %&gt;  <span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
       <span class="err">&lt;</span>% end %&gt;
     <span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
     <span class="err">&lt;</span>% else %&gt;
     <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span> <span class="err">&lt;</span>%= message %&gt; <span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
     <span class="err">&lt;</span>% end %&gt;
   <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="err">&lt;</span>% end %&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"> <span class="n">flash</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:danger</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="vi">@product</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">errors</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">full_messages</span></code></pre></figure>
